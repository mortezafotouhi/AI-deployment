    "content": "Pour beaucoup, boire de l\u2019alcool est une fa\u00e7on de sociabiliser ou de se d\u00e9tendre. Si boire un verre d\u2019alcool est un de vos plaisirs, vous vous demandez peut-\u00eatre si cela vous est autoris\u00e9 pendant votre traitement par chimioth\u00e9rapie. Vous pourrez peut-\u00eatre boire tr\u00e8s mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment, mais cela d\u00e9pend de diff\u00e9rents facteurs :  \n#### **1. Du type de chimioth\u00e9rapie que vous suivez**\nBoire de l\u2019alcool n\u2019est pas incompatible avec la plupart des types de chimioth\u00e9rapie mais les interactions avec certaines peuvent \u00eatre nocives. Votre m\u00e9decin et le personnel infirmier vous diront si vous devez \u00e9viter l\u2019alcool pendant votre chimioth\u00e9rapie.  \n#### **2. Effets secondaires du traitement**\n\u00c9vitez l\u2019alcool si vous avez des naus\u00e9es, vous vous sentiriez encore plus mal. Si vous d\u00e9veloppez des douleurs buccales pendant la chimioth\u00e9rapie, l\u2019alcool pourrait piquer.  \n#### **3. Changements de go\u00fbts**\nLa chimioth\u00e9rapie peut modifier le go\u00fbt des aliments et boissons. Si l\u2019alcool a mauvais go\u00fbt, vous n\u2019en voudrez peut-\u00eatre pas.

M\u00eame si vous pouvez boire de l\u2019alcool pendant le traitement, il est conseill\u00e9 de r\u00e9duire votre consommation d\u2019alcool autant que vous le pouvez.  \n\n#### **Comment diminuer la consommation d\u2019alcool**\nPenser \u00e0 arr\u00eater ou r\u00e9duire votre consommation d\u2019alcool peut vous sembler difficile. Voici quelques astuces : \n\n* Fixez-vous une limite de consommation. Vous pouvez demander \u00e0 votre m\u00e9decin de vous y aider.  \n* Notez vos progr\u00e8s sur une application ou dans un journal. \n* Ne stockez pas d\u2019alcool chez vous. \n* Trouvez des boissons non alcoolis\u00e9es que vous appr\u00e9ciez pour remplacer l\u2019alcool. \n* Demandez \u00e0 vos amis ou \u00e0 des membres de votre famille de r\u00e9duire leur consommation avec vous, cela est b\u00e9n\u00e9fique pour tous. \n* Trouvez des activit\u00e9s sociales qui n\u2019impliquent pas de boire, comme marcher dans la nature, aller boire un caf\u00e9 ou aller voir un film. \n\nSi vous pensez avoir besoin de plus de soutien, parlez-en \u00e0 votre m\u00e9decin g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste ou appelez le num\u00e9ro national d\u2019Alcool info service : [0 980 980 930]\n\n<sup>`FR-NONO-00895 Mars 2024 `<sup>"

Vous pouvez \u00e9galement ajouter des prot\u00e9ines en poudre \u00e0 vos smoothies. \n* Essayez d\u2019inclure des aliments riches en prot\u00e9ines dans votre r\u00e9gime alimentaire tels que des \u0153ufs, du poisson, de la viande, des produits laitiers, des noix et des graines. \n* Savourez des collations saines \u00e0 des moments de la journ\u00e9e o\u00f9 vous avez g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un peu plus d\u2019app\u00e9tit, par exemple une pomme avec du beurre de noix ou des b\u00e2tonnets de carottes et du houmous. \n* Ajoutez des calories en cuisinant au beurre, \u00e0 l\u2019huile d\u2019olive ou de coco et en couvrant vos plats de fromage r\u00e2p\u00e9. \n\n### D\u00e9tendez-vous et essayez de profiter de vos repas \n* Sans faire de la pr\u00e9paration des aliments une corv\u00e9e, essayez de bien pr\u00e9senter vos aliments sur votre assiette car on mange d\u2019abord avec les yeux.  \n* Faites de vos repas une exp\u00e9rience relaxante en m\u00e2chant et en avalant doucement. \n* Prenez le temps de vous d\u00e9tendre et de vous mettre \u00e0 l\u2019aise apr\u00e8s un repas. \n* Ne soyez pas trop dur(e) avec vous-m\u00eame ; si vous ne voulez vraiment pas manger, faites autre chose et r\u00e9essayez plus tard.  \n* Mangez des aliments froids peut aider si vous ne vous sentez pas bien. \n\n### Demandez des conseils nutritionnels \u00e0 votre \u00e9quipe soignante \n* Parlez-en \u00e0 votre \u00e9quipe soignante si vous avez des questions nutritionnelles.  \n* Vous entendrez peut-\u00eatre parler de r\u00e9gimes ou de compl\u00e9ments alimentaires pouvant vous aider \u00e0 combattre le cancer et \u00e0 apaiser les effets secondaires du traitement, mais il n\u2019existe aucune preuve scientifique les concernant. Certains peuvent m\u00eame \u00eatre dangereux pour votre sant\u00e9. Soyez prudent(e) avant d\u2019ajuster votre alimentation, et parlez-en toujours \u00e0 votre \u00e9quipe soignante afin de vous assurer que ces changements sont bien adapt\u00e9s.  \n\n<sup>`FR-NONO-00895 Mars 2024 `<sup>"

    "content": "### **What is the EQ-5D-5L?**\nThe EQ-5D-5L is a questionnaire that is used to measure how high someone\u2019s quality of life is. It has five questions that focus on different \u2018dimensions\u2019, or areas, of your wellbeing: \n1. Mobility  \n2. Self-care \n3. Usual Activities  \n4. Pain / Discomfort \n5. Anxiety / Depression \n\nFor each question, you can pick an answer from 1 to 5: \n1. No problems  \n2. Some problems \n3. Moderate problems \n4. Severe problems \n5. Unable to do / Extreme problems \n\n### **What does EQ-5D-5L stand for?**\nThe name comes from what is measured and how it is set up: \n* EQ stands for \u2018EuroQol\u2019, the name of the group that created the questionnaire. \n* 5D stands for the five \u2018dimensions\u2019 or health areas that the questionnaire covers. \n* 5L stands for the five \u2018levels\u2019 you can choose from when you answer.\u202f \n\n### **Why is it important?**\nIt allows you to track over time how your everyday life, wellbeing and health is impacted by your disease and treatment.\u202f \n\nYou can use your results to have conversations with your Care Team to understand how you're feeling and what kind of help you might need. It's a tool to tell them about your wellbeing and health over time without needing a long talk or medical tests. \n\n### **How do I use it?**\nEach month, you will be asked to complete the questionnaire. Just follow the prompts in the app to complete it. Your answers will be put into a score and graph to track your health. \n\n### **What does the score mean?**\nThe scores you pick for each question are put together and arranged in a line to describe your overall health. For example, if you pick all 1s, it means you don't have any health problems. This would be shown as \u201811111\u2019. Higher numbers indicate that you are having some problems. \n\n### **What does each section mean?**\nYou can select a different value on the EQ-5D-5L module to see your previous answers in a graph: \n![Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 16.49.12](https://content.internal.huma.com/api/assets/education-content/de287e09-b796-4d72-9bc8-486df0b159cd/screenshot-2024-03-06-at-16.49.12.png 'Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 16.49.12')\n\n**1. Health State**\nThis is a 5-digit summary code for how you have answered the questions in the survey.  \n![Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 16.49.22](https://content.internal.huma.com/api/assets/education-content/aa7ac3ef-9570-4579-9918-335aee029625/screenshot-2024-03-06-at-16.49.22.png 'Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 16.49.22')\n\n**2. Index Value**\nThis is a number from 0 to 1 that summarises your answers to the 5 health questions into one overall score of your health.  \n\n**3. EQ VAS**\nThis is the last question in the survey where you are asked to rate your health from 0 to 100. This slider is known as the \u2018Visual Analogue Scale\u2019 or \u2018VAS\u2019.  \n![Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 16.49.33](https://content.internal.huma.com/api/assets/education-content/61482b84-42f5-43c8-885b-ad571abce4a7/screenshot-2024-03-06-at-16.49.33.png 'Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 16.49.33')\n\n**4. Mobility** \nThis is about moving around. Can you walk and move without help?  \n\n**5. Self-care** \nThis is about taking care of yourself. Can you bathe, dress, and use the toilet by yourself? \n\n**6. Usual Activities**\nThis is about doing things you normally do. Can you go to school, work, or do your hobbies? \n\n**7. Pain/Discomfort**\nThis is about how much you hurt or feel uncomfortable. \n\n**8. Anxiety/Depression**\nThis is about how you feel in your mind. Are you worried, sad, or calm and happy? \n\n<sup>Job code: `UI-AVE-00361`\nDate of production: `Mar 2023 `<sup>"

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nNo dose reduction for BAVENCIO is recommended. For immune-mediated adverse reactions, withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO depending on severity. In general, withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reactions. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reactions, recurrent severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated reactions that require systemic immunosuppressive treatment, or an inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks of initiating corticosteroids. In general, if BAVENCIO requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic corticosteroids (eg, endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed in subsequent sections.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for Grade 2, and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or Grade 4 pneumonitis. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.2% (21/1738) of patients, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.6%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all (21/21) patients with pneumonitis.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated colitis. The primary component of immune-mediated colitis consisted of diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Withhold BAVENCIO for Grade 2 or Grade 3, and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 colitis. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.5% (26/1738) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.7%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all (26/26) patients with colitis.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause hepatotoxicity and immune-mediated hepatitis. Withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO based on tumor involvement of the liver and severity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin elevation. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred with BAVENCIO as a single agent in 0.9% (16/1738) of patients, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.6%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all (16/16) patients with hepatitis.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause primary or secondary immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement, as clinically indicated. Withhold BAVENCIO for Grade 3 or Grade 4 endocrinopathies until clinically stable or permanently discontinue depending on severity. Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.5% (8/1738) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all (8/8) patients with adrenal insufficiency.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement, as clinically indicated. Withhold BAVENCIO for Grade 3 or Grade 4 endocrinopathies until clinically stable or permanently discontinue depending on severity. Immune-mediated pituitary disorders occurred in 0.1% (1/1738) of patients, which was a Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reaction.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism, as clinically indicated. Withhold BAVENCIO for Grade 3 or Grade 4 endocrinopathies until clinically stable or permanently discontinue depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.2% (4/1738) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 0.4% (7/1738) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 29% (2/7) of patients with hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 5% (90/1738) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (3.7%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 7% (6/90) of patients with hypothyroidism.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated type I diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold BAVENCIO for Grade 3 or Grade 4 endocrinopathies until clinically stable or permanently discontinue depending on severity. Immune-mediated type I diabetes mellitus occurred in 0.1% (2/1738) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.1%) adverse reactions.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction. Withhold BAVENCIO for Grade 2 or Grade 3, and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 increased blood creatinine. Immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction occurred in 0.1% (1/1738) of patients, which was a Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reaction. Systemic corticosteroids were required in this patient.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, including rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis including Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), has occurred with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Withhold BAVENCIO for suspected and permanently discontinue for confirmed SJS, TEN, or DRESS. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 5% (90/1738) of patients, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (2.0%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 29% (26/90) of patients with dermatologic adverse reactions.\n\nBAVENCIO can result in other immune-mediated adverse reactions. Other clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% in patients who received BAVENCIO or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. For myocarditis, permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for Grade 2, Grade 3, or Grade 4. For neurological toxicities, withhold BAVENCIO for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or Grade 4.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to the first 4 infusions and for subsequent infusions based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion-related reactions. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for Grade 3 or Grade 4 infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25% of patients, including three (0.2%) Grade 4 and nine (0.5%) Grade 3 infusion-related reactions. Eleven (92%) of the 12 patients with Grade \u22653 reactions were treated with intravenous corticosteroids.\n\nFatal and other serious complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can occur in patients who receive HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n\nBAVENCIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus including the risk of fetal death. Advise females of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BAVENCIO and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO.

Advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of BAVENCIO due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (all grades, \u226520%) in patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) were fatigue (50%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), diarrhea (23%), nausea (22%), infusion-related reaction (22%), rash (22%), decreased appetite (20%), and peripheral edema (20%).\n\nSelected treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities (all grades, \u226520%) in patients with metastatic MCC were lymphopenia (49%), anemia (35%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (34%), thrombocytopenia (27%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (20%).\n\nA fatal adverse reaction (sepsis) occurred in one (0.3%) patient with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) receiving BAVENCIO + best supportive care (BSC) as first-line maintenance treatment. In patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic UC, fourteen patients (6%) who were treated with BAVENCIO experienced either pneumonitis, respiratory failure, sepsis/urosepsis, cerebrovascular accident, or gastrointestinal adverse events, which led to death.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (all grades, \u226520%) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC receiving BAVENCIO + BSC (vs BSC alone) as first-line maintenance treatment were fatigue (35% vs 13%), musculoskeletal pain (24% vs 15%), urinary tract infection (20% vs 11%), and rash (20% vs 2.3%). In patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic UC receiving BAVENCIO, the most common adverse reactions (all grades, \u226520%) were fatigue, infusion-related reaction, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, decreased appetite, and urinary tract infection.\n\nSelected laboratory abnormalities (all grades, \u226520%) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC receiving BAVENCIO + BSC (vs BSC alone) as first-line maintenance treatment were blood triglycerides increased (34% vs 28%), alkaline phosphatase increased (30% vs 20%), blood sodium decreased (28% vs 20%), lipase increased (25% vs 16%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (24% vs 12%), blood potassium increased (24% vs 16%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (24% vs 12%), blood cholesterol increased (22% vs 16%), serum amylase increased (21% vs 12%), hemoglobin decreased (28% vs 18%), and white blood cell decreased (20% vs 10%).\n\nIndications\nMetastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)\n\nBAVENCIO\u00ae (avelumab) is indicated for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic MCC.

    "content": "### **Making a treatment plan that works for you**\n\nThe goal of chemotherapy is to kill as many cancer cells as possible, so it\u2019s important you attend all your infusions to give you the best chance of benefitting from it. Your care team can help you plan your infusion appointments around any special requests, such as a holiday or family event. Try to tell your care team about these as soon as possible so that they can book infusion appointments that work best for you.\n\n### **Your care team may advise you to skip an infusion**\nYour care team may advise you to skip an infusion or pause infusions for a while. This can happen for a few reasons. If you\u2019re having particularly bad side effects from chemotherapy, your care team may recommend reducing the dose or delaying your next infusion to give your body time to recover. \nYou\u2019ll also have regular blood tests to check that the rest of your body is staying healthy during chemotherapy. If your care team thinks your body needs a break from chemotherapy to rest and recover, they might suggest missing one or more infusions until your blood tests show you can continue. We understand that skipping or pausing infusions can cause worry and confusion, but try not to think of these breaks as setbacks. Everyone responds to chemotherapy differently and your care team are making sure your treatment is best for your overall health.\nSomeone from your care team will discuss your blood test results and how you are feeling at your appointments and advise you if any changes to your treatment plan are needed. If you are thinking of pausing or stopping chemotherapy for any reason, it\u2019s important that you speak to your care team first.\n\n<sup>Job code: `UI-AVE-00282`\nDate of production: `Mar 2023 `<sup>"

If you or anyone else shows any of the following symptoms and you think they might be having a heart attack or stroke, call 911 immediately. \n\n## Stroke- Think F.A.S.T.\nUse the letters FAST to spot a stroke\n* F = Face drooping- does one side of the face droop or is it numb? Is the person able to smile evenly?\n* A = Arm weakness- is one arm weak or numb? Is the person able to raise both arms without one drifting downwards?\n* S = Speech difficulty- is speech slurred?\n* T = Time to call 911- stroke is an emergency, and every minute counts. Call 911 immediately and make a note of when the symptoms first started.\n\n## Heart attack\nCall 911 if you experience:\n* Chest discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes \u2013 or it may go away and then return. It can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain.\n* Discomfort in other areas of the upper body. Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.\n* Shortness of breath. This can occur with or without chest discomfort.\n* Other signs.

    "content": "Since the 1990s, research has shown that following simple steps in modifying your diet can have a beneficial impact on your blood pressure. Read on to find out which foods to choose and which to avoid when thinking about your blood pressure!\n\n\n## 4 foods to avoid\n* **Salty food**. We should aim to have no more than 6g of salt (roughly a teaspoon) each day. The majority of high-salt foods in most people\u2019s diets comes from pre-made and takeout food. \n* **Sugary and fatty food**. While these don\u2019t directly raise your blood pressure, eating too many of these foods can cause weight gain, which is linked to high blood pressure.\n* **Alcohol**. Drinking alcohol can increase your blood pressure and lead to weight gain. It\u2019s best not to drink any alcohol at all, but if you do drink alcohol, drink in moderation.\n* **Excess caffeine**. While caffeine can raise your blood pressure, its effect normally doesn\u2019t last very long. However, some people are more sensitive to its effects.\n\n## 4 foods which lower blood pressure\n* **Fruit and vegetables**. It\u2019s thought that foods containing nitrates, like beetroot, spinach, celery, kale, bananas and strawberries can help lower your blood pressure. Fruits and vegetables also contain potassium, which helps your body lower blood pressure by itself. It\u2019s much better to get potassium from food rather than supplements. \n* **Wholegrains**. Brown rice, wholewheat bread and oats are packed with nutrients and fiber. Getting more fiber in your diet has been linked with a lower risk of heart and blood vessel problems.\n* **Lean protein**. Proteins like chicken, fish, turkey and beans are lower in calories than red and processed meats. This can help manage your weight, which helps to lower your blood pressure. \n* **Low fat dairy**. Low fat dairy contains a complex mix of nutrients including calcium, without the extra fat. Including milk and low-fat natural yogurt is therefore a great way to help lower your blood pressure. \n\n\nRemember, changing your diet happens one step at a time. Making small, healthier choices and sticking to them can make a big difference in the long term!\n\n[Learn more](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/high-blood-pressure-diet)\n\n[How to reduce your salt intake](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/shaking-the-salt-habit-to-lower-high-blood-pressure)\n"

    "content": "To address your high blood pressure, your healthcare professional may recommend prescription medication along with lifestyle changes based on your individual needs. \n\nThere are many types of medication used to lower blood pressure. We\u2019ve summarized some of the most common ones and some key side effects to look out for below. \n\nSide effects which can occur as a result of any anti-hypertensive (blood pressure medication) include dizziness, fainting, abnormal blood salt levels, and overcorrection of your blood pressure, making it too low. \n\n**ACE Inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)**. \nThese classes of medications work by making artery walls relax, reducing the blood pressure inside the blood vessels. Specific side effects may include a cough (ACEis), high blood potassium and occasionally kidney damage. You will often receive a blood test before and after starting either of these medications. If you are a woman taking either of these types of medication and are planning pregnancy or think you might be pregnant, talk to your doctor immediately. \n\n**Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs).** CCBs cause relaxation and widening of your artery walls, reducing blood pressure. They also help to reduce the heart rate. Common side effects may include swollen ankles, constipation and headaches. \n\n**Thiazide-like diuretics.** These reduce blood pressure by encouraging the body to get rid of excess salt and water in the urine. Side effects may include an increased risk of gout, difficulty managing sugar levels in diabetes, and changes in sexual function. \n\nThe particular medications you are prescribed will vary depending on how high your blood pressure is, your age and ethnicity, and whether you have any other medical conditions. \n\nIf your blood pressure is still high despite using these medications, a doctor may decide to try additional, more specialized medications.\n\nIt is important to remember that making healthy changes to your lifestyle is still extremely important to manage your blood pressure, even if you\u2019re taking medications.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4845275/)\n\n[More examples of blood pressure medications](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/types-of-blood-pressure-medications)\n\n"

Here\u2019s what to expect:\n\n# Preparing for the test\n\nBefore the test, follow these steps to ensure an accurate reading:\n* Avoid exercise, coffee, and cigarettes for 30 minutes before the test.\n* Visit the bathroom\n* Relax quietly in a chair for at least 5 minutes, keeping your feet flat on the floor.\n* Rest your arm on a table so it is supported and at the level of your heart.\n* If it is the first time your provider has measured your blood pressure, you may have readings taken on both arms.\n\n# How blood pressure is recorded\n\nThe blood pressure cuff will be wrapped around your upper arm and will inflate for a few seconds, temporarily stopping the blood flow. This will feel like someone is squeezing your arm, but it won\u2019t be painful. As the cuff deflates, your healthcare provider will make a note of the blood pressure readings while listening with a stethoscope, or by looking at an electronic device. \n\n# Follow up\n\nIf your blood pressure is too high the first time your blood pressure is measured, you will need to have your blood pressure recorded again at another time. This is because there are several reasons your blood pressure can appear falsely high. Taking two readings on different days helps make the diagnosis.

It is an extremely common condition- nearly half of all American adults have high blood pressure. It is one of the leading global causes of death, causing more than million deaths every year.\n\nHigh blood pressure usually develops slowly over time and can be influenced by various lifestyle factors including what you eat, how active you are, and if you smoke or drink alcohol.\n\nThe big problem caused by high blood pressure is increased work placed on the heart and blood vessels, making them less efficient. Over time, the force damages arteries, narrowing the vessels and creating a cycle that harms the heart and body. This can lead to serious conditions such as heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.\n\nHigh blood pressure is often called a 'silent killer' because it may not show obvious symptoms.

The circulatory system plays a key role in delivering oxygen-rich blood to tissues and organs. The heart pumps blood into blood vessels called arteries, veins, and capillaries. \n\n# What is blood pressure\nThe pressure of blood pushing against the inner walls of your arteries is your blood pressure. If this pressure is consistently higher than normal, this is described as hypertension, or high blood pressure. \n\nBlood pressure readings contain two numbers. \n* **Systolic blood pressure**. This measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart is squeezing. \n* **Diastolic blood pressure**. This measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart is resting between beats. \n\n# An example\nIf you had a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, your systolic blood pressure would be 120 and diastolic blood pressure 80.

    "content": "Even if you don\u2019t feel unwell, untreated high blood pressure can lead to serious health problems over time. High blood pressure increases the risk of these conditions by damaging blood vessels and body organs. \n\nSome of the risks of leaving high blood pressure untreated include:\n\n* **Heart attack or stroke**. High blood pressure damages your arteries, making them harder and thicker. This increases the risk of a blockage in the arteries supplying your heart or brain- the cause of heart attacks and strokes.\n* **Heart failure**. Having higher blood pressure forces your heart to work harder to pump blood around your body. Over time the heart wall thickens- a condition called ventricular hypertrophy. Eventually, the heart can\u2019t pump enough blood to meet the body\u2019s needs, causing heart failure. \n* **Kidney disease**. High blood pressure can narrow or weaken the small blood vessels in your kidneys, leading to kidney damage.\n* **Aneurysm**. Increased blood pressure can cause blood vessels to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm. A ruptured (burst) aneurysm, although rare, can be life-threatening.  \n* **Eye problems**. High blood pressure can cause thickened, narrowed, or torn blood vessels in the eyes. This can cause vision loss.\n* **Memory changes**. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can affect your ability to think, remember and learn new information. Having high blood pressure also increases the risk of developing some types of dementia later in life.\n* **Sexual dysfunction**. Raised blood pressure can cause erectile dysfunction in men, and may lead to lower libido in women.\n\nFollowing your doctor\u2019s advice on controlling your blood pressure, by making changes to your lifestyle and in some cases by taking medication, can help reduce the risk of these health conditions. \n\n[Learn more](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/health-threats-from-high-blood-pressure)\n\n[How high blood pressure can damage your arteries](https://watchlearnlive.heart.org/index.php?moduleSelect=highbp)"

During this treatment, your care team will look at test and scan results to see how the cancer reacts to chemotherapy. If you hear them say that your cancer did not \u2018progress\u2019, then your cancer did not grow or spread during chemotherapy. This could mean your cancer either did not change in size (the cancer may be called \u2018controlled\u2019 or \u2018stable\u2019) or the cancer got smaller or disappeared (called a \u2018response\u2019 to treatment). In both of these situations, your care team may suggest that you start maintenance therapy, which aims to further delay the cancer from reappearing, growing or spreading.\n\nYour maintenance therapy uses a drug called BAVENCIO\u25bc(avelumab), a type of immunotherapy which helps your immune system to fight the cancer. This is given as an infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion) once every two weeks. Maintenance therapy aims to keep the cancer from reappearing, growing or spreading for as long as possible. Your care team will discuss with you how long you will stay on treatment. During maintenance therapy, you\u2019ll have regular blood tests and scans which give your care team information about how your body and the cancer are reacting to the treatment. They will also ask you about how you\u2019re feeling and discuss options with you. If the cancer starts to grow while on maintenance treatment, your care team might recommend that you move on to second-line treatment to help control the cancer.\n\n*\u25bcThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ for the UK, or www.hpra.ie for Ireland, for how to report side effects.*\n\n<sup>Job code: `UI-AVE-00309`\nDate of preparation: `March 2024`<sup>\n"

    "content": "Caring for a loved one can have a huge impact on your physical and emotional wellbeing. So, it\u2019s good to remember that looking after yourself is just as important as looking after the person you care for. \n\nTaking care of yourself is not something to feel guilty about, especially as it can help you to do the best possible job caring for your loved one. Here are some tips to help you to think about your needs and look after your well-being, so you can feel better and provide support for your loved one.  \n\n### **Talk to others**\nWhile caring for someone you love can feel rewarding, it can also be difficult. Being a carer takes up a lot of time, and can make you feel sad, stressed, angry and lonely. This is normal, and it\u2019s completely OK to have these feelings.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to reach out to others for support. This may seem difficult at first, but being open and honest with those around you can be helpful for many reasons. It can help you cope with the challenges of caregiving by allowing others to understand what you\u2019re going through and how you\u2019re feeling. \n\nIt may not feel easy asking for help, but you can speak to trusted friends or family about how you\u2019re feeling and ask them for help even with simple tasks. This could be things like keeping the person you care for company for a while so that you can have a break; picking up shopping; or jobs around the home. You can also talk to your care team about any additional support that is available for carers, such as home nursing support. Caregiver support groups can also help you to connect with others who are going through similar situations to you.\n\n### **Take time out**\nMaking time for yourself to relax and recharge is not always easy. But looking for those \u2018in-between\u2019 moments, even if it\u2019s only five minutes, can be really good for your wellbeing.\nTry thinking of some enjoyable activities that you can schedule into your day. Here are a few suggestions:\n* Reading a book, magazine or newspaper\n* Watching your favourite film or TV show\n* Doing something creative like drawing or painting\n* Going for a walk in nature\n* Listening to your favourite music \n* Chatting to a loved one\n* Seeing a close friend\n* Taking a relaxing bath \n\n<sup>Job code: `UI-AVE-00308`\nDate of preparation: `March 2024`<sup>"

If there\u2019s no change, this is a sign that treatment is working and should be continued if tolerable. If scans show the cancer has changed, your care team will discuss next steps with you.\n\n### **What happens during a scan?**\nThese are 2 common types of scans:\n* Computed tomography (CT or CAT scan), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked to lie on a bed which moves into a machine, shaped like a long tube. Scans can take up to 90 minutes. You\u2019ll need to stay still and may also need some dye, which will be injected into your arm intravenously, to help make the images clear. Your care team will be able to help if you\u2019re worried about the injection or being in the machine. \n\nIt's completely normal to feel anxious about having a scan. Try deep breathing, meditation or listening to music beforehand. Planning something you enjoy after the scan can also take your mind off it. During the scan, try closing your eyes, doing some breathing exercises, or counting down slowly from 100 to help stay relaxed. Your care team may also provide ear plugs or play music, as the machines can be loud. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about what your results might be, remember that you can always talk to your care team, friends and family or attend a support group meeting. \n\n<sup>Job code: `UI-AVE-00323`\nDate of preparation: `March 2024`<sup>"

    "title": "Bladder cancer: What to know",
    "content": "### **How does bladder cancer occur?**\nThe human body is made up of trillions of cells, which grow and multiply to keep the body working as it should. If the cells are not quite right (abnormal), or are worn out or damaged, they die and new cells grow and replace them. But sometimes, those abnormal or damaged cells start to divide and reproduce uncontrollably, which can form a tumour. Bladder cancer occurs when a tumour develops in the tissue that lines the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract.\n\n### **What is staging and grading of bladder cancer?**\n**Cancer staging** describes the size of the tumour and whether it has spread from where it first started.\nThe cancer will be classified into various stages:\n* Stage 1: The cancer has stayed inside the bladder (\u201cprimary site\u201d). \n* Stage 2: The cancer has spread into the thick layer of muscle in the wall of the bladder. \n* Stage 3: The cancer has spread outside the bladder into surrounding tissues, and/or to nearby lymph nodes (\u201clocally advanced\u201d)\n* Stage 4: The cancer has spread to at least one other organ, such as the liver or lungs, and/or to distant lymph nodes (\u201csecondary\u201d or \u201cmetastatic\u201d). \n\n**Cancer grading** describes how abnormal the cancer cells look compared to normal cells and can help your care team know how the cancer might behave.\nBladder cancer cells are divided into 3 grades:\n* Grade 1 \u2013 the cancer cells look very similar to normal bladder cells.  They tend to grow slowly and are less likely to spread outside the lining of the bladder. \n* Grade 2 \u2013 the cancer cells tend to be slightly faster growing and are likely to spread.\n* Grade 3 \u2013 the cancer cells usually grow and spread more aggressively.\n\nWhen discussing your results with your care team, don\u2019t be afraid to ask if you have any concerns, uncertainties or questions. It\u2019s very important that you understand all the information that you\u2019re given.  \n\n<sup>Job Code: `GL-AVE-00411`\nDate of preparation: `January 2024`<sup>"

If you have a better understanding of how these changes to your body and mood might affect you, you will be better prepared and able to manage those changes if they happen.\n\n### **Talking it out**\nSharing how you\u2019re feeling may seem difficult at first.

You could try these simple techniques:\n\n**Creating a bedtime routine:** Having a specific bedtime routine is really useful.  This will tell your body that it\u2019s time to wind down, relax and start getting sleepy. Around 30-60 minutes before bed, why not try: dimming the lights, turning off your phone and/or the TV, taking a warm bath, reading a book or meditating for a while.\n\n**Establishing a sleep/wake routine:** Try sticking to the same bedtime and wake-up time every day, even on the weekends.  Keeping to the same sleep routine will help to maintain your body\u2019s internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep at night and have you wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. Avoiding naps will help too, as staying awake in the day means you\u2019re more likely to fall asleep at night. If you\u2019re so tired in the day that you really need to nap, try to keep it to only 30 minutes.\n\n**Keeping a sleep diary:** Spending just 5 minutes each morning to keep a record of your night\u2019s sleep, can be really useful in helping you to notice any patterns in your sleeping habits. When filling in your sleep diary, try answering these questions:\n\n* What time did you go to bed last night?\n* How long did it take you to fall asleep?\n* How many times did you wake up in the night?\n* What time did you wake up in the morning?\n* How would you rate the quality of your sleep last night?\n\n<sup>Job code: `UI-AVE-00283`\nDate of preparation: `January 2024`<sup>"

These medicines are often in a form of an inhaler but can also be nebulised or taken as a tablet. \n\n## Examples of reliever medications\nThe two types of relievers are short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) and short-acting anticholinergic (SAMA).\n\n### SABAs\n\n* Used for short-term relief of symptoms.\n* Examples: Albuterol, Ventolin. \n\nIf you are taking too much of the SABAs, you may experience trembling, nervousness, headaches or palpitations. \n\n### SAMAs\n\n* Used for short-term relief of symtpoms.\n* Example: Atrovent.\n\nPotential side effects include a dry mouth, constipation, a cough, headache and feeling sick.\n\nIf you are experiencing side effects or if you have to use your relievers more than 3 times a week, it could be a sign your condition is not well controlled.

Planning how you will stop and visualising your success can help you build confidence.\n\n3. **Stress management**. Many people smoke when they feel stressed. Staying on top of your stress will decrease the times you might want to reach for a cigarette. Try mindful practices like breathing work or ask your non-smoking friends for tips on how they keep stress at bay.\n\n4. **Recognize it's never too late to quit**. Wherever you are in your smoking journey, it is always better to stop smoking than not. It will make your lungs and wallet happier!\n\n5. **Learn from past experiences**. Most ppeople who smoke have tried to quit in the past, and some were successful for weeks, month or years. Quitting smoking is hard, so don't beat yourself up if you tried before and it didn't work out. Think about what you have learned from your past experience, what worked for you and what didn't, and try again. \n\n### Seeking support\nShare your goal with friends and family, you might find their support useful when things get tough. Professional help from organizations like the American Lung Association is also available, offering guidance and resources.\n\n### Medication assistance\nFDA-approved medications, such as nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, inhaler, nasal spray, varenicline (Chantix), and bupropion (Zyban), can be effective.

It triggers asthma attacks, and contributes to around 90 percent of lung cancer deaths and roughly 80 percent of deaths related to COPD. \n\n## Tobacco products\nA tobacco product is anything containing, made of, or derived from tobacco or nicotine. This includes commercial cigarettes, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and various nicotine-containing items like pouches, gummies, or toothpicks. What you should remember:\n\n* Secondhand smoke is comparable to direct smoking. It causes over 41,000 deaths every year.\n* Marijuana smoke has harmful substances like tobacco, posing health risks.\n* E-cigarettes have unclear health effects and raise health concerns.\n* Smokeless tobacco is addictive and can cause cancer. It is not a safe alternative to cigarettes. \n* Cigars, similar to cigarettes, carry health risks, including cancer.\n* Hookah smoke is similarly harmful to cigarette smoke.\n* Nicotine in tobacco products is highly addictive.\n* Menthol, a common flavoring, makes smoking more appealing and addictive.\n\n## E-cigarettes and vapes\nE-cigarettes, including e-pens, e-pipes, e-hookah, and e-cigars, collectively known as ENDS, are battery-powered devices. They let people breathe in a mist with nicotine or other substances. The main part is the e-liquid in cartridges or tanks. It usually has:\n* Nicotine from tobacco\n* Flavors\n* Colors\nIn addition to these three componenets, e-cigarettes and vapes can also include many other chemicals that may cause permanent lung damage. It is best to not use these devices as alternatives to smoking. If you are thinking of quitting speak to your doctor about available support. \n\n### Learn more\n1.

    "title": "Decoding Spirometry, FEV1 & Peak Flow",
    "content": "# What is spirometry?\nSpirometry is a common breathing test that checks how well your lungs are working. It measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also checks how easily and quickly you can blow the air out of your lungs.\n\nIt helps to diagnose lung issues like asthma and COPD and keeps track of your condition. This test can also check whether your medications or inhalers are doing their job. \n\nThe spirometers you were provided with measure two things about your lung function:\n\n* Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1): The amount of air you can push out of your lungs in 1 second. \n* Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF): How air flows out of your lungs in one quick blast.\n\n\n## 1. Why measure FEV1?\nFEV1 is used in diagnosis of lung conditions such as asthma and COPD.  Overtime, as COPD progresses the value of your FEV1 may change. Measuring and monitoring FEV1 regularly can help spot if your lung function is decreasing quickly. This will help your care team and doctor adjust your treatment for the best results.\n\n* Perform FEV1 at least once a week.\n* Record it in your Huma app.\n\n## 2. Why measure your peak flow?\nPeak flow helps you and your doctor to understand your COPD and to optimise your medications. For example, if you are having a COPD flare-up, your peak flow value may decrease, as less air is able to flow through your airways. Monitoring peak flow is important because:\n\n* It acts like an early warning system, spotting airway narrowing.\n* Keeping an eye on changes helps you act early to prevent serious COPD flare-ups.\n* Perform peak flow at least once a week and report the results in the Huma app to stay on top of your COPD.\n\nThe video below explains how to use a peak flow meter. [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NBeSbiqeOo)\n\n\n## 3. How to interpret results\nYour personal best peak flow number is the highest value you have reached while feeling well. It is your baseline. You can use it as your reference when measuring your peak flow values.\n\nTo find your personal best peak flow number, take your peak flow each day for 2 to 3 weeks while feeling well. \n\nYour peak flow zones resemble a traffic light system:\n\n* Green Zone - 80%-100% of personal best: All clear with no COPD symptoms. Continue daily medications. \n* Yellow Zone - 50-80% of personal best: Caution; consider quick-relief medication and potential adjustments in treatment. \n* Red Zone - below 50% of personal best: Signals a medical emergency, requiring prompt use of quick-relief medicine and immediate medical attention.\n\n### Learn more\n1.

    "content": "# How quick-relief medicines help\nQuick-relief medicines, also called rescue medicines, help you breathe better when asthma symptoms start. They are usually taken as inhalers but can be given as nebulizers or orally. In hospital some are even through a special tube in their vein.\n\nYou breathe them in, and within minutes, they relax the muscles around your airways. This makes it easier to breathe. You can also use them before exercise to prevent asthma symptoms.\n\n## Using quick-relief medicine too much\nThese medicines work well for about 4 to 6 hours, but remember, they are not meant to be used every day. If you find that you need to use them most days, you should tell your doctor; you may need a different type of medication.\n\nIf you use your quick-relief medicine too much:\n* Your body may stop responding to it.\n* You could become more sensitive to things that trigger your asthma, like pollution and chemicals.\n* You might have a higher chance of getting a lung infection.\n\n### Learn more\n1.

It is a leading global cause of death, accounting for 10.4 million deaths annually.\n\nThe primary harm caused by high blood pressure is an increased workload on the heart and blood vessels, making them less efficient. Over time, the force and friction damage artery tissues, leading to the formation of plaque and the onset of atherosclerosis, narrowing the arteries and creating a cycle that harms the heart and body. \n\nHigh blood pressure can result in conditions such as:\n\n* Arrhythmia\n* Heart attack\n* Stroke\n\nHigh blood pressure is often termed a **'silent killer'** because it may not exhibit noticeable symptoms. Regular monitoring, lifestyle changes, and early intervention are crucial for prevention and management.\n\n## Few important facts about high blood pressure:\n* Many individuals with high blood pressure are unaware of their condition due to a lack of noticeable signs and symptoms.\n* High blood pressure typically develops slowly over time and can be influenced by various factors.\n* High blood pressure cannot be cured, but it can be effectively managed. \n* Lifestyle modifications and, in some cases, medication are key components of management.

It's okay to feel these things, but if they stick around for weeks, it could be a sign of anxiety or depression. Don't hesitate to talk about it with your doctor and get the support you need.\n\n## Recognising the symptoms of anxiety, panic, and depression\n### Anxiety and panic\nAnxiety is common in people who have COPD: \n\n* As COPD causes breathing to be more shallow, our brain can perceive this as a potential stressful situation. To keep us safe, our brain can trigger a stress response in the body, which we feel as anxiety.\n* Panic attacks or sudden intense fear can change the normal breathing pattern, making breathing much quicker. This can worsen the sensation of shortness of breath. As you experience that, you might breath even quicker. This can create a loop where breathlessness triggers anxiety.\n\nTo avoid those uncomfortable feelings, you may stop doing things that cause you shortness of breath such as going for walk and staying active. This strategy can worsen your symptoms in the long run as keeping active strenghtens lungs and has been shown to improve mental health. If you are finding it difficulty to keep active, start with walking shorter distances or find a walking buddy to help distract your thoughts. \n\n### Depression\nClinical depression is prolonged deep sadness or emptiness, lasting more than a few weeks. It affects enjoyment of work, relaxation, and relationships, impacting overall life satisfaction. Untreated depression can limit the ability to stay active and enjoy life.\n\n## Things you can do for anxiety and depression\n### Communicate with your healthcare provider\n* Discuss your mood and emotions with your healthcare provider.\n* Work together to understand the causes and identify coping strategies.\n* Consider consultation with a mental health professional for counseling or medication.\n\n### Take care of yourself\n* Stay active to help both your physical and mental health.\n* Do activities you enjoy, see friends, and spend time outdoors.\n* Manage stress and reduce shortness of breath through relaxation techniques and breathing exercises.\n* Prioritize self-care, including a balanced diet, hydration, adequate sleep, and a consistent daily routine.\n* Develop coping strategies and create a toolbox to handle stress. \n\nThere isn't one strategy that works for everyone but trying several different ones will help you find ones that are right for you. Some coping skills to try include journaling, walking in nature, deep breathing, doing your favourite hobby. \n\n### Seek support\nDon't hesitate to ask for help when feeling isolated or overwhelmed. Reach out to friends, family, neighbors, and your care team for assistance.\n\n### Connect with others\n* Join COPD support groups, such as [Better Breathers Club](https://www.lung.org/help-support/better-breathers-club).\n* Share experiences with those who understand the challenges of living with COPD.\n* Contact the [Lung Helpline](https://www.lung.org/help-support/lung-helpline-and-tobacco-quitline) for expert information and resource referrals.\n\n*Remember, you are NOT alone.\nSeek support from COPD communities and helplines.*\n\n**If thoughts of self-harm arise, contact a doctor, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline (1-800-273-8255), or emergency services immediately.**\n\n### Learn more\n1.

Available treatment options aim to:\n\n* Control symptoms.\n* Slow disease progression.\n* Reduce flare-ups.\n* Improve activity levels.\n\n## Commonly used treatments \n\nThe most commonly used treatment for COPD includes inhaled medications that help to open up your airways, so that the air can pass more easy and improve your symptoms. These medicines are called 'bronchodilators'.\n\n### Relievers \nSome of the bronchodilators are 'short-acting', meaning they offer quick relief, acting within minutes, but their effect lasts only 4-6 hours. These are either short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) or short-acting anticholinergic (SAMA).\n\n### Maintenance therapy\nOther types of inhalers are 'long-acting', meaning it takes longer for them to start working, but the effect is felt for approximately 12-24 hours. These are either long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) or long-acting anticholinergic (LAMA).\n\nDepending on your symptoms and how severe your COPD is, different inhalers might be tried. Some inhalers can have more than one medicine in them. This is called combination therapy. \n\n## Other COPD medications \n\n### Anti-inflammatory (Inhaled Corticosteroid - ICS):\nAim: Reduces inflammation, swelling, and mucus production in airways.\nOften used in combination therapies.\n\n### PDE4 inhibitors \nExample: Daliresp\nAim: Opens up the airways and reduces inflammation. Helps to prevent flare-ups.\nFor patients with severe COPD, it is taken as a tablet.\n\n### Antibiotics:\nAim: Prescribed during flare-ups caused by bacterial or viral infections.\nThe full course should be finished to prevent resistance or recurrence.\n\n### Vaccinations:\nAim: As your lungs are already under stress from COPD, vaccinations are important for preventing complications and lung damage from respiratory infections like flu, COVID-19, and pneumonia.\n\n### Learn more\n1.

    "content": "# How eating right can help with COPD symptoms\nThe food you consume plays a role in fueling your body's activities. Metabolism is how your body turns food into energy. For people with COPD, breathing uses more energy, and they might feel out of breath while eating. Your body uses the food you eat as a source of energy. \n\nEating whole foods with high energy content, such as protein and fat, may improve your symptoms when eating. For example, choose whole milk and full fat yogurt instead of low-fat alternatives. \n\n## What helps against shortness of breath when eating\n* Rest before meals.\n* Eat slowly and take smaller bites.\n* Maintain an upright sitting position.\n* Incorporate breaks between bites for deep breathing exercises.\n* Front-load your meals, especially if fatigue hinders eating later in the day.\n* Avoid gas-inducing foods that can make breathing difficult (eg. beans, lentils, cereal, crackers, onions and garlic).\n* Consume 4 to 6 small meals daily to facilitate diaphragm movement.\n* Manage liquid intake during meals to prevent feeling overly full.\n\n## Useful nutritional guidelines to follow\n\n* **Carbohydrates:** Opt for whole-grain bread, pasta, and fresh fruits and vegetables.\n* **Fiber:** Aim for 20 to 30 grams daily from sources like bread, pasta, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables.\n* **Protein:** Eat a good protein source twice a day, like milk, eggs, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, nuts, or beans.\n* **Fats:** Prefer mono- and polyunsaturated fats from plant sources. Limit trans fats and saturated fats found in butter, lard, fried foods, and pastries.\n* **Vitamins and minerals:** Consider a multivitamin, especially if using steroids. Discuss calcium supplements with your doctor.\n* **Salt:** Manage salt intake to prevent edema and high blood pressure. Explore herbs and spices for flavoring.\n* **Fluids:** Stay hydrated with 6 to 8 glasses (8 ounces each) of water daily. Caffeine-free fluids and fluid-rich foods count toward your goal.\n* **Medical nutritional products:** Consider liquid supplements if regular foods don't meet your nutritional needs, as recommended by your dietitian or doctor.\n\nFor a personalized meal plan, you can work with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). To find a RDN ask your doctor or visit the  [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.eatright.org).\n\n### Learn more\n1.

    "content": "# Using your COPD medications\n\n## Optimizing medication use\nWhile medication doesn't cure COPD, it helps to manage symptoms and improve activity levels. Delivery methods include inhalers, nebulizers, breath-actuated devices, and pills. Here are some tips to help you adhere to your treatment:\n\n* Establish a consistent medication schedule by setting reminders in your Huma app under \"Medications\".\n* Utilize weekly pill boxes, routine habits, alarms, or in-home medication management programs.\n* Maintain organized records, especially when traveling.\n\n## Monitoring and adjusting medications\nRegular review of your medications and inhaler technique can help you get the most out of your treatment. Staying in control of your COPD requires:\n\n1. Communicating any ongoing symptoms, concerns, or side effects. \n2. Adjustments to your treatment plan based on your changing needs.\n\nYou can use the Huma app to help with communicating your symptoms so that your care team can pick it up.\n\n## Types of inhalers\nYour controller inhaler comes in three types:\n\n1. **Metered dose inhalers** (MDIs): These spray the medicine.\n2. **Breath actuated inhalers** (BAIs): They release the medicine when you start to breathe in.\n3. **Dry powder inhalers** (DPIs): These provide the medicine as a dry powder, not a spray.\n\n## How to improve your inhaler technique\n\n1. Before you take your inhaler, breathe out to empty your lungs.\n2. Inhale the medicine at a steady pace. Don't breathe in too fast or too slowly for your device.\n3. If you're using a breath-activated inhaler, make sure you inhale with enough force to get the medicine out.\n4. Breathe in through your mouth, not your nose.\n5. Hold your breath for 10 seconds after taking the medicine (or as long as you can).\n6. If you cough while using your inhaler, you might need to take another puff.\n7. Wait for 1 minute between doses to let the medicine settle in your lungs. And if you're using a press-and-breathe inhaler, give it a shake between doses (but not all inhalers need shaking!).\n\nUseful video on how to use a metered-dose inhaler.\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i9_DelNqs4)\n\nRemember, the goal is to enhance your quality of life by finding the right medication, taking it correctly, and adapting the plan as needed. \n\n### Learn more\n1.

Here is what you need to know: \n\n* COPD is a chronic condition, meaning it's there every day, and it tends to get worse over time. \n* COPD includes conditions such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema.\n* In emphysema, the air sacs in your lungs are damaged, making breathing difficult.\n* In bronchitis the airways of the lungs are widened allowing for too much mucus to build up, causing troublesome coughing and wheezing.\n\n## What causes COPD?\nSmoking is one of the key causes of COPD. Cigarette smoke weakens lung defenses, narrows airways, and damages lung air sacs. Other factors that can lead to COPD include: \n\n* Long-term exposure to chemicals, dust, and fumes at work.\n* Prolonged exposure to air pollutants from sources like vehicles and factories.\n* Sometimes there can be a genetic condition affecting a lung-protecting protein, causing lung damage.\n\n## COPD risk factors\n* Smoking\n* Childhood lung infections\n* Air pollution\n* History of asthma\n* Underdeveloped lungs at birth\n* Age 40 and older\n\n### Learn more\n1.

    "content": "# Understanding your lungs\nOur bodies need oxygen to stay alive, and we get it from the air we breathe. Lungs are like special bags in our chest that help us with this. The main job of your lungs is to move fresh air into your body while removing waste gases. \n\nAside from this, your respiratory system has other important functions for breathing, such as:\n\n* Adjusting air to the right temperature and humidity level.\n* Protecting your body from harmful substances by coughing, sneezing, filtering, or swallowing them.\n* Supporting your sense of smell.\n\n\n## The parts of the respiratory system and how they work\n\n### Airways\nThe airways are made up of several structures.\n* Sinuses: Empty spaces in the bones near your eyes, connected to the nose, helping control air temperature and humidity.\n* Nose: The main way air enters your respiratory system, with tiny hairs cleaning the air.\n* Mouth: Another entrance, useful when the nose is blocked or during heavy exercise.\n* Throat: Gathers air from the nose and mouth, passing it down to the windpipe.\n* Windpipe (Trachea): The passage leading from the throat to the lungs.\n* Bronchial Tubes: Where the windpipe splits into two main tubes. These passages bring air to the lungs.\n\n### Lungs and blood vessels\nLungs and blood vessels team up to make sure your body gets oxygen and gets rid of waste. \n\n* Lungs: Your right lung has three parts called lobes, and your left lung has two lobes. Each lobe is like a balloon filled with sponge-like stuff.\n* Cilia: Small hair-like structures covering airways, moving mucus to the throat for removal of dust and germs.\n* Bronchioles: Smallest branches of bronchial tubes leading to air sacs (alveoli).\n* Alveoli: Tiny air sacs in the lungs where oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs.\n* Capillaries: Very small blood vessels that help with moving the oxygen to other parts of the body.\n\n### Muscles and bones\nYour diaphragm and ribs work together to make sure you can breathe in fresh air and let out the old air.\n\n* Diaphragm: A robust muscle wall that separates your chest from your belly. It moves down, creating suction in the chest, pulling in air to expand the lungs.\n* Ribs: These bones support and shield your chest. They move a bit to assist your lungs in expanding and contracting.\n\nWatch this short video to learn how lungs work.\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIAoGZPw0zE)\n\n### Learn more\n1.

    "content": "# Testing for COPD\nTo diagnose COPD, your healthcare provider will follow a comprehensive process as outlined below.\n\n## 1. Health history and physical exam\n* Smoking history, exposure to secondhand smoke, air pollution, work-related exposures, and childhood respiratory infections.\n* History of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and symptoms like shortness of breath, chronic cough, or coughing up mucus will be discussed.\n* Family history of COPD or other lung diseases, the impact of symptoms on daily life, and factors triggering symptom worsening will be explored.\n* Other health conditions like heart disease, osteoporosis, anxiety, or depression will be considered.\n\n## 2. Test results\n* Spirometry checks lung function and airflow problems\n* Blood tests and imaging help rule out other conditions or measure COPD severity\n\n## 3. COPD staging\nDoctors use a system called 'GOLD' criteria to decide the stage or grade of your COPD. Depending on the stage, you will be offered different treatment options. \n\nGOLD stands for the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease. It was started in 1997 by The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, and the World Health Organization.\n\n### What does the GOLD system look at?\nOnce a diagnosis of COPD has been made using a spirometer, your doctor will carry out an assessment of your COPD to better understand what treatment you might need. \n\nThe assessment will focus on four fundamental areas:\n\n1. Spirometry results\n2. Severity of symptoms\n3. Flare-up risk\n4. Presence of other health conditions\n\n###  Spirometry grades\nYour GOLD grade depends on the spiroemetry value, FEV1. \nIt is a reflection of how well you can breath. Based on the impairment of airflow, COPD is classified into four grades: \n\n* Grade 1: Mild\n* Grade 2: Moderate\n* Grade 3: Severe\n* Grade 4: Very severe\n\nHaving a more advanced grade of COPD such as Grade 3 or Grade 4 makes it more likely that you will have a flare-up in the future. Another way of predicting future flare-ups is by looking at how often you had them in the past. \n\n### Assessing symptoms\nOne way of assessing and monitoring your symptoms is through a questionnaire called the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). You can do the test in the Track page of your Huma app. \n\n### COPD Groups \nBased on all of these criteria (spirometry results, symptom severity, flare-up risk and other health conditions), your COPD will be classified into one of these groups:\n\n**Group A** (GOLD 1 or 2):\n* Mild symptoms.\n* FEV-1 is 80% or higher.\n* Few or no flare-ups in the past year.\n* No hospitalization for symptoms.\n\n**Group B** (GOLD 1 or 2):\n* More symptoms compared to Group A.\n* FEV-1 is between 50% and 80%.\n* Possibly one major flare-up but no hospitalization in the past year.\n\n**Group C** (GOLD 3 or 4):\n* Severe limitation of airflow.\n* FEV-1 is between 30% and 50%.\n* More than two flare-ups in the past year or at least one hospitalization.\n\n**Group D** (GOLD 3 or 4):\n* Extremely challenging breathing.\n* FEV-1 is below 30%.\n* At least two flare-ups in the past year or at least one hospitalization.\n* Considered \"end-stage\" COPD with very limited lung function.\n\nYour doctor keeps an eye on how serious your COPD is from the start of your diagnosis. They look at your stage, history, flare-up risk, and symptoms to choose the best medicines for you.\n\nIn the Huma app, we'll ask you to do things like spirometry, share your symptoms and flare-ups, answer a CAT questionnaire, and talk about your medicines. By giving us this info, we can stay on top of your COPD together and aim for a better quality of life for you.\n\n### Learn more\n1. [2023 GOLD Report](https://goldcopd.org/2023-gold-report-2/)\n2.

Sources of pollution \n* Avoid indoor burning: Fires, candles, and incense can release pollutants.\n* Choose fragrance-free products to avoid harmful chemicals being released into the air.\n* Do not smoke or vape indoors, as tobacco smoke and aerosols emit pollutants.\n* Keep pets off furniture, especially if you are allergic to pets. \n* Use dust mite covering for mattresses and pillows.\n* Install an EPA-certified woodstove if this is how you keep your house warm.\n* Vacuum with a HEPA vacuum weekly to reduce dust and pollutants from carpets.\n* Use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens, especially when cooking.\n\n### 2. Ventilation\n* Open doors and windows for 15 minutes each day to let in fresh air. \n* It's not a good idea to ventilate your space on days with bad outdoor air quality.\n* The quality of air is measured using an Air Quality Index (AQI), which is just a scale that is measured from 0-500. The higher the number, the bigger the risk to health. \n\nYou can check your most recent AQI on the Track page of your Huma app. Here\u2019s how to understand whether it is safe for you to go outdoors:\n\n* **An AQI under 50** means good air quality. It\u2019s safe for outdoor activities.\n* As the AQI goes up, the air becomes less safe to breathe.\n* **An AQI above 300** is hazardous, meaning it's very unsafe.\n\n### 3. Air cleaning \n* Air cleaning or filtration can help to reduce pollutants already present in the air, but they cannot fully get rid of them.\n* You can choose from two main types of air cleaners: portable air cleaners and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. \n\n### Learn more\n1.

    "content": "In this lesson, you will learn how to create your own content\n1. [Introduction](#introduction)\n2. [Jumping to specific header sections](#jumpingtospecificheadersections)\n3. [Uploading videos](#uploadingvideos)\n\n# Introduction\nSquidex is a content management software we use in Huma to manage the production content patients see. It's important you use \"Heading 1\" by putting # in front of the header as you see before the 'Introduction' header above. Where there are sub headers, add another #. See the following paragraphs for other content formats.\n\n# Jumping to specific header sections\nAs you can see at the top of this article body, you are able to jump to specific header sections. You will need to remove all punctuations, special characters and ensure everything is in lowercase. \n\n# Uploading videos\n## Youtube video\nYou can preview any public viewable Youtube video by putting it in the format below:\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdVKpUR513M)\nIt is extremely important that you preview the article before publishing it. You should be able to play the video within the article webpage itself with 1-click. \n\n## Client-provided video\nYou can upload up to 600MB videos onto the Squidex asset library. Unlike the youtube video, you will need to put the link in an iframe format see below.\n\n[](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Xwib1CxE2NoKeaqWQCvL3yb3d6F0jdo/preview)\ntest\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9;\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Xwib1CxE2NoKeaqWQCvL3yb3d6F0jdo/preview\" title=\"Video Player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIt is extremely important that you preview the article before publishing it. Similar to Youtube embeded video, you should also be able to play the video within the article webpage itself with 1-click. \n\n# Uploading photos\nYou will be able to add photos from your asset library and add assistive description for visually impared users, which can also be seen when you hover over the picture\n\n![Running](https://content.internal.huma.com/api/assets/education-content/2641d3a4-06ac-4337-aa92-7934a9df912c/running.webp 'running')\n\n# How to hyperlink text\nIf you want to add a weblink embedded within text, this is how you format it: [Read more on NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/)\n\nIf you want to add just the link without embedding within test, simply add the link to the body: [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/)\n\n# URL and slug\nAfter an article has been published, it's important that you keep the slug consistent as this is used as the URL extension when we configure learn content in pp-server-config or Admin portal. The slug is automatically generated based on the title of the article but you can edit it below.\n\n# Excerpt & therapeutic\nEach article must have an Excerpt briefly describing the content in 2-3 sentences. Each article must also have an Therapeutic area for better categorising of the articles. We expect around 20-30 articles per therapeutic area per language. As such, we need to categorise our learn content to allow for better digital hygenine and change management.\n\n# Drafts & publishing\nThere are 2 main permissions - editing and publishing.\nWe recommend Editing content and only publishing when its complete. For an existing published article, we recommend creating a new draft and saving against the new draft. When the draft has been approved by the right people, this is when you can publish it. \n\nThe published draft update for an existing published article will automatically go to Production. \n\nOnly administrators can delete articles and this permission lies with sre@huma.com at the moment. \n\n# Video walkthrough\nWatch this video to explain how to create your content with a demo: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/10jnKzDZFF2tR5PbP4p8I6juPXCBOlyvp/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10jnKzDZFF2tR5PbP4p8I6juPXCBOlyvp/view?usp=sharing)\n\nYou will need a Huma email address to access this."
