# AI-deployment

See the report for details on the algorithm and an overview of the project.

To execute the project, run the main file.

When "debug = True", you can view the output in console.

If "full_deployment = True" and "debug = False", a new deployment will be created, and you will be prompted to enter an email to invite you as a "User". Please note that your email should not have been registered for any previous deployments.

If you prefer to replace the old deployment rather than creating a new one, simply set "full_deployment = False", "debug = False". In this scenario, you only need to invite yourself for the first time. You need to set "new_deployment = True" for the first run, and change it to "False" for subsequent runs.

When "simple_method = True", a comprehensive prompt will generate the list of deployment components. The output will be just visible in the console.
